# Factorial, Permutation, and Combination Calculator App

This is a standalone application for performing mathematical calculations such as factorial, permutation, and combination. The app is built using Python and packaged as an executable for ease of use.

## Features
- **Factorial Calculation**: Quickly computes the factorial of a non-negative integer.
- **Permutations (nPr)**: Calculates the number of ways to arrange `r` objects from a set of `n` objects.
- **Combinations (nCr)**: Determines the number of ways to choose `r` objects from a set of `n` objects.
- **Interactive Menu**: User-friendly interface with clear options.

## How to Use
1. Run the executable file (`Factorial_Permutation_Combination_App.exe`).
2. Choose an option from the menu:
   - `1` for factorial calculation.
   - `2` for permutations.
   - `3` for combinations.
   - `0` to exit the program.
3. Enter the required inputs as prompted.
4. The app will display the calculated result.

## Requirements
- **No installation needed!** Simply run the executable on your system.
- Compatible with Windows operating systems.
